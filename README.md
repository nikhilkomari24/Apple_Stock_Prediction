# Apple_Stock_Prediction
Stock market financial advisors often require
trends to determine if a stock should be traded as a future,
option, forward, swap or another financial instrument. This
project analyzes the auto regressive integrated moving average
(ARIMA), long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent
unit (GRU) and ARIMA-LSTM hybrid models' ability to
forecast Appleâ€™s current opening day stock price. Model
hyperparameters are tuned using Bayesian optimization. Root
mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and
mean forecast error (MFE) are the accuracy measures used for
model analysis. Results of analysis show that the ARIMA-LSTM
hybrid model is the most accurate followed by GRU, LSTM
and ARIMA models.
